# maze-generator

This is a project I've been thinking about a lot for the last few months. Before diving into it and start coding, I wanted to understand the way a maze is randomly generated.
Once I found the algorithm I wanted to use, in this case a backtracking recursive one, I took a look at data structures. I really wanted to know what was my plan before trying anything. The trial and error would be on the writing of the code, not the way I intended to generate the maze. 

For the last few days, I've been working on it on and off on the maze generator. I wanted to push a working version at first and then try to optimize it as much as I can.

NB : The max grid size that can be generated for now is 64x65 (4160 nodes)
